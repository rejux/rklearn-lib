For Developers
==============

The 1st Time
============

Confer docs/01-cde-dev.txt.

The Venv
========

If it is the 1st time, then you need to create the dir to host the venvs and the venv itself:

(base) $ python -m venv ~/venvs/rklearn-lib
(base) $ source ~/venvs/rklearn-lib/bin/activate 
(rklearn-lib) (base) $ 


[OPTIONAL] upgrade pip:
(rklearn-lib) (base) $ pip install --upgrade pip

Install the requirements: 
(rklearn-lib) (base) $ pip install -r requirements.txt

    Troubleshoot
    ============

    If ERROR: No matching distribution found for mkl-fft==1.0.15 (from -r requirements.txt (line 5))
    Then
        - edit the requirements.txt and comment all the lines "mkl-...==..."

    Test if your CUDA layer is compatible with your TF version:

    $ python
    >>> import tensorflow as tf
    ...
    ...
    >>> sess = tf.Session()             // or >>> sess = tf.compat.v1.Session() 
    ...
    Found device 0 with properties:
      name: GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER major: 7 minor: 5 memoryClockRate(GHz): 1.77
    ... 
    Found device 1 with properties:
      name: GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER major: 7 minor: 5 memoryClockRate(GHz): 1.77
    
    ... Successfully opened dynamic library libcudart.so.10.0 
    ... 


Now, everything is ok!

Business As Usual (BAU)
=======================

After a session with the container, always generate the requirements.txt file and commit the container:

(rklearn-lib)...$ pip freeze >requirements.txt
